        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <!--Short passage-->
        <p style="text-align: left;">After my first year of college, I took a leave of absense from school for personal
          reasons. After two years
          from that break, it became difficult to jump back in school. I knew I wanted to go back, but I
          struggled to find the career path I was most passionate about. I narrowed my choices and came to the
          conclusion that technology and computers was what I am most passionate about. My family always came to me when
          the computer wasn't working properly or when they had a question about a certain action they wanted the
          computer to produce. The world of technology has fascinated me from a young age, and it is one of the reasons
          I pursued a career in software engineering, web development, and web design. </p>
        <!--List of hobbies-->
        <p style="text-align: left;"> Outside the tech world, I pass my time by: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spending time with family, my pups, and friends.</li>
          <li>I also enjoy the outdoors; hiking, camping, and traveling.</li>
          <li>I am athletic person. I enjoy any sport activites, but my favorite is playing basketball.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If you are looking to hire a full stack web developer who is passionate about this
          field and willing to
